This is a manual to the classes run by Fingal County Council in Lesotho in February 2015. 

It serves as a guid to perform the basic GIS functions to extract useful information from OpenStreetMap data for Lesotho.

These manuals assume that you have OpenGeoSuite installed and working correctly.

This means you should have** PgAdmin 3**,** Postgres** and **PostGIS** started and finally **QGIS** for visualizing your results.
