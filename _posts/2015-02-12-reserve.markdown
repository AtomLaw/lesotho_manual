**THIS IS A DRAFT AND THEREFORE NOT COMPLETE**

### Road reservations
- Focusing on appropriate development distance from roads. Spec. Primary Roads.
- 15m either side from center line of road.
	- Building features
	- Power Lines
	- Any permanent structure.

Statistics on the number of permanent structures within this reservation.

**Key Steps**

1. Select all the primary roads. ```planet_osm_lines```
2. Create a 15m buffer around the roads.
3. Find all the buildings within the buffer zone.
4. Find all power lines (line, poles), sewer lines (line, manholes), trees, billboards.
5. Categorize structure distance from road centerline. (**0-5m, 6-10m, 11-15m**) 

## **Some Notes**

Throughout this guide when Open PgAdmin SQL window is stated this means we should have the following screen open.

![sqlwindow][sqlw]

**Every Query should be execute unless otherwise stated!** To execute you can press ```F5``` on your keyboard or else click the same button indicated below:

![sqlwindowe][sqlex]


## Find all primary highways
First we need to do some data discovery and find out what are the tags used for roads in Lesotho. We will do a count on all the highway tags to see if ```primary``` exists in the highway column.

Open the PGadmin SQL window and paste in the following query:

	**QUERY EXPLANATION**
	Here we get all the unique values of the highway column in the table planet_osm_line
	and then count them. Next the result is aggregated by each different value within 
	the highway column such as primary, seconadary, track, etc. 

{% highlight ruby%}
# display count of all highway tags
SELECT highway, COUNT (*)
FROM planet_osm_line
WHERE highway IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY highway
{% endhighlight %}

Now that we can see **primary** does exist we will now create a new table of just the **primary roads**.

To do this we will use the ```WHERE``` clause so that only rows where the value in column ```highway``` is equal to ```primary```.

Open the PGadmin SQL window and paste in the following query:

	**QUERY EXPLANATION**
	In this query we find all the rows of the highway column in the table planet_osm_line
	where the value is primary only.
	We then add all these rows to a new table called primary_roads.

{% highlight ruby%}
# find and create table the primary roads
CREATE TABLE primary_roads AS
SELECT highway, way
FROM planet_osm_line
WHERE highway = 'primary'
{% endhighlight %}

You can then open QGIS and load the primary_roads table as a new layer.

**Add PostGIS Layer -> Connect -> primary_roads -> Add**

The first step is now complete.

## Create the Roads Reservation
This step follows on from the previous tutorials and follows the same basic query.

We need to create a 15 meter buffer around the centerline of the road to represent the 15 meter reservation on either side of primary roads in Lesotho.

To do this we will use the ST_Buffer(geom, 15m) function yet again. We will create a new table which contains the result of the buffering operation.

Again we open the **PgAdmin SQL Query Window** and paste in the query below.

	**QUERY EXPLANATION**
	Draw a buffer around the roads centerline that is 15 meters wide. 
	The buffer is first created around every line segment. 
	Then we use union to dissolve/merge the buffers into one. 
	Then we insert this buffer into a new table called Create a table called road_buffer from the result of querying the primary 
	roads table. 
	 
This is how we can create just a single buffer.

{% highlight ruby %}
CREATE TABLE road_buffer_15 AS
SELECT ST_Union(ST_Buffer(way, 15)) AS the_geom
FROM primary_roads
{% endhighlight %}

We will need buffers at the following distances 5, 10, 15 and 25 meters. To do this we use the same query as a above but add more rows to the table. 

**Copy and Paste this Query into you SQL Query Window.**

{% highlight ruby %}
DROP TABLE road_buffer_151;
CREATE TABLE road_buffer_151 AS 
SELECT ST_Union(ST_Buffer(way, 25)) AS the_geom, 25 AS dist
FROM primary_roads;

INSERT INTO road_buffer_151 (the_geom, dist)
SELECT ST_Union(ST_Buffer(way, 15)) AS the_geom, 15
FROM primary_roads;

INSERT INTO road_buffer_151 (the_geom, dist)
SELECT ST_Union(ST_Buffer(way, 10)) AS the_geom, 10
FROM primary_roads;

INSERT INTO road_buffer_151 (the_geom, dist)
SELECT ST_Union(ST_Buffer(way, 5)) AS the_geom, 5
FROM primary_roads;

{% endhighlight %}

Now **Open QGIS** and add the new table as a **New PostGIS Layer** ![pg][pg_layer]. 

Find the layer in the list of tables and **Left Click** to select it. **Click Add.**

![pg][layer1]

**Double Click** on the layer in the **Layers Panel** on the left and **Click Styles.**

![pg][layer2]

From the top bar select the drop down and select Graduated.

![pg][layer5] 

Next we will apply some thematic styling to our layer. We will add a graduated red to yellow color from the center of the road. The 5 meter reservation will be red and the 25 meter will be yellow.

On the right at **Mode** click the drop down and **Equal Interval** from the list. Change the number above this to **4**.

Next check the **Invert** box beside **colour ramp**.

For the **colour ramp** select the ```YlOrRd``` one from the list.

**Click** the **Symbol box** above and then **change the transparency to 50%**

You should end up with something looking like this.

![pg][layer6] 


The resulting layer could look like below, where I have buildings already loaded along side our river buffers from yesterday.

![buffer][buffer]

We can now move onto the next step which is to quantify how many buildings are within each of the reservation zones.


## Quantify number of structures in each zone
{% highlight ruby %}
CREATE TABLE buildings_in_reserve AS
	25 AS dist,
	(SELECT building, way FROM lesotho_buildings
	WHERE 
		ST_Intersects(
			(
				SELECT the_geom
				FROM road_buffer_151 
				WHERE dist = 25
			), way
		)) AS the_geom
{% endhighlight %}

 
15 poles within buffer
